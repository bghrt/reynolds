    <h3 class="blacktext"><img src="../images/11-12/andredubus.jpg" alt="Andre Dubus III" width="220" height="288" class="author" />About the Author</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">&quot;Andre Dubus III grew up in mill   towns on the Merrimack River along the Massachusetts-New Hampshire   border. He began writing fiction at age 22 just a few months after   graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelors   Degree in Sociology. Because he prefers to write in the morning, going   from &quot;the dream world to the dream world&quot;, as the Irish writer Edna   O'Brien puts it, he took mainly night jobs: bartender, office cleaner,   halfway house counselor, and for six months worked as an assistant to a   private investigator/bounty hunter. Over the years he's also worked as a   self-employed carpenter and college writing teacher. </p>
    <p align="left">Andre Dubus III is the author of a collection of short fiction, <a linkindex="6" href="http://andredubus.com/cagekeeper.html"><u><em>The Cage Keeper and Other Stories</em>,</u></a> and the novels <a linkindex="7" href="http://andredubus.com/bluesman.html"><u><em>Bluesman</em></u></a>, <a linkindex="8" href="http://andredubus.com/houseofsandandfog.html"><u><em>House of Sand and Fog</em></u></a> and <a linkindex="9" href="http://andredubus.com/gardenoflastdays.html"><u><em>The Garden of Last Days</em></u></a>, a New York Times bestseller. His memoir, <a linkindex="10" href="http://andredubus.com/townie.html"><u><em>Townie</em></u></a>,   is forthcoming in February 2011 with W.W. Norton &amp; Co. His work has   been included in The Best American Essays of 1994, The Best Spiritual   Writing of 1999, and The Best of Hope Magazine.  He has been awarded a   Guggenheim Fellowship, The National Magazine Award for fiction, The   Pushcart Prize, and was a Finalist for the Rome Prize Fellowship from   the Academy of Arts and Letters. &quot; - from <a href="http://andredubus.com/bio.html">http://andredubus.com/bio.html</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">&quot;Andre Dubus III  wastes no time in capturing the dark side of the   immigrant experience  in America at the end of the 20th century. <em>House of Sand and  Fog</em> opens with a highway crew composed of several nationalities  picking up   litter on a hot California summer day. Massoud A<img src="../images/11-12/HouseofSand.jpg" alt="Hosue of Sand and Fog" width="172" height="258" align="right" />mir  Behrani, a former   colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah,  reflects on his   job-search efforts since arriving in the U.S. four  years before: &quot;I   have spent hundreds of dollars copying my  credentials; I have worn my   French suits and my Italian shoes to  hand-deliver my qualifications; I   have waited and then called back  after the correct waiting time; but   there is nothing.&quot;  The father of  two, Behrani has spent most of the   money he brought with him from Iran  on an apartment and furnishings   that are too expensive, desperately  trying to keep up appearances in   order to enhance his daughter's  chances of making a good marriage. Now   the daughter is married, and on  impulse he sinks his remaining funds   into a house he buys at auction,  thus unwittingly putting himself and   his family on a trajectory to  disaster. The house, it seems, once   belonged to Kathy Nicolo, a  self-destructive alcoholic who wants it   back. What starts out as a  legal tussle soon escalates into a personal   confrontation--with dire  results. </p>
    <p> Dubus tells his tragic tale   from the viewpoints of the two main  adversaries, Behrani and Kathy. To   both of them, the house represents  something more than just a place to   live. For the colonel, it is a foot in the  door of the American dream;   for Kathy, a reminder of a kinder, gentler  past. In prose that is   simple yet evocative, <em>House of Sand and Fog</em> builds to its inevitable denouement, one that is painfully dark but  unfailingly honest.&quot; <em>--Alix Wilber</em>, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Sand-Fog-Andre-Dubus/dp/0393338118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307038531&sr=8-1">Amazon.com Review</a></p>

    <h2><em>Like Water for Chocolate </em>by Laura Esquivel</h2>
    <h3><img src="../images/11-12/lauraEsquivel.gif" alt="Laura Esquivel" width="180" height="213" class="author" /><span class="blacktext">About the Author</span></h3>
	<p>"Mexican writer and author. Born on September 30, 1950, in Mexico   City, Mexico. Esquivel began writing while working as a kindergarten   teacher. She wrote plays for her students and then went on to write   children's television programs during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

    <p>Esquivel often explores the relationship between men and women in Mexico in her work. She is best known for <em>Like Water for Chocolate</em> (1990), an imaginative and compelling combination of novel and   cookbook. It had been released in Mexico a year earlier. After the   release of the film version in 1992, <em>Like Water for Chocolate</em> became internationally known and loved. The book has sold more than 4.5 million copies. </p>
    <p>Esquivel   has continued to show her creative flair and lyrical style in her later   work. Accompanied by a collection of music, her second novel <em>The Law of Love</em> (1996) combined romance and science fiction. <em>Between the Fires</em> (2000) featured essays on life, love, and food. Her novel, <em>Malinche</em> (2006), explores the life of a near mythic figure in Mexican   history-the woman who served as Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés's   interpreter and mistress.&quot; - from <a href="http://www.biography.com/articles/Laura-Esquivel-185854">Biography.com</a></p>
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">&quot;Each chapter of screenwriter Esquivel's utterly charming interpretation   of life in turn-of-the-century Mexico begins with a recipe--not   surprisingly, since so much of the action of this exquisite first novel   (a bestseller in Mexico) centers around the kitchen, the heart and soul   of a tradition<img src="../images/11-12/like-water-for-chocolate.jpg" alt="Like Water for Chocolate" width="100" height="150" align="right" />al Mexican family. The youngest daughter of a well-born   rancher, Tita has always known her destiny: to remain single and care   for her aging mother. When she falls in love, her mother quickly   scotches the liaison and tyrannically dictates that Tita's sister   Rosaura must marry the luckless suitor, Pedro, in her place. But Tita   has one weapon left--her cooking. Esquivel mischievously appropriates   the techniques of magical realism to make Tita's contact with food   sensual, instinctual and often explosive. Forced to make the cake for   her sister's wedding, Tita pours her emotions into the task; each guest   who samples a piece bursts into tears. Esquivel does a splendid job of   describing the frustration, love and hope expressed through the most   domestic and feminine of arts, family cooking, suggesting by implication   the limited options available to Mexican women of this period. Tita's   unrequited love for Pedro survives the Mexican Revolution the births of   Rosaura and Pedro's children, even a proposal of marriage from an   eligible doctor. In a poignant conclusion, Tita manages to break the   bonds of tradition, if not for herself, then for future generations.&quot; - <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Like-Water-Chocolate-Installments-Romances/dp/038542017X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307039163&sr=8-1">Amazon.com</a></p>

    <p>&quot;From a single, abbreviated life grew a seemingly immortal line of cells   that made some of the most crucial innovations in modern science   possible. And from that same life, and those cells, Rebecca Skloot has   fashioned in <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> a fascinating   and moving story of medicine and family, of how life is sustained in   laboratories and in memory. Henrietta Lacks was a mother of five in   Baltimore, a poor African American migrant from the tobacco farms of   Virginia, who died from a cruelly aggressive cancer at the age of 30 in   1951. A sample of her cancerous tissue, taken without her knowledge or   consent, as was the custom then, turned out to provide one of the holy   grails of mid-century biology: human cells that could survive--even   thrive--in the lab. Known as HeLa cells, their stunning potency gave   scientists a building block for countless breakthroughs, beginning with   the cure for polio. Meanwhile, Henrietta's family continued to live in   poverty and frequently poor health, and their discovery decades later of   her unknowing contribution--and her cells' strange survival--left them   full of pride, anger, and suspicion. For a decade, Skloot doggedly but   compassionately gathered the threads of these stories, slowly gaining   the trust of the family while helping them learn the truth about   Henrietta, and with their aid she tells a rich and haunting story that   asks the questions, Who owns our bodies? And who carries our memories?&quot;   --<em>Tom Nissley</em> from<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Immortal-Life-Henrietta-Lacks/dp/1400052181/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307039769&sr=8-1"> Amazon.com Review</a></p>
