	<h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
    <p><em>Word Wizard</em> is a  "collection of light-hearted essays pokes, prods and pinches the   English language, taunting and protecting it like an older brother <img src="../images/10-11/wordwizard.jpg" alt="Word Wizard" width="172" height="258" align="right" />might   for his weakling sibling. Lederer, a language columnist and author of   Anguished English, often demonstrates the point of his essays with the   language used to write them (a diatribe against the use of 'fadspeak'   and clichés is composed almost exclusively of phrases from the maligned   categories) and asserts that &quot;if plagiarism is the sincerest form of   flattery, I am one of the most flattered people alive,&quot; citing the   prevalence of his columns-often sans byline-in chain emails. (Which may   explain why some of this material seems stale.) His upbeat tone results   in Pollyannaish prose, and some of his essays, such as the interview   with the palindrome-spouting camel, are clever but fail to convey a   message. There are a number of gems sprinkled throughout this book, and   attentive readers will take away interesting language facts, new ideas   for their own writing and even an inspired car-trip word game. Essays of   note include a history of the English language, why single-syllable   words are better than their multi-syllabic counterparts, and a wildly   inaccurate portrayal of the history of the world cobbled together   entirely from student essays. Though classified as a reference, this   book works best as a casual reader for grammar geeks.." - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Word-Wizard-Super-Bloopers-Reflections/dp/0312351712/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1280757334&amp;sr=1-3">Publisher's Weekly, from Amazon.com</a></p>

    <h2><em>Dying for Heaven</em> by Ariel Glucklich</h2>
    <h3><img src="../images/10-11/glucklich.jpg" alt="Lynn H. Nicholas" width="160" height="213" class="author" /><span class="blacktext">About the Author</span></h3>
	<p>"Ariel Glucklich is a professor of religion at Georgetown University. He   specializes in Hinduism and in the psychology and biology of   religion. He is particularly interested in what motivates people to   become and remain religious and the various ways that religion makes   people self-destruct. <br />
      <br />
Glucklich is the author of several books on Hinduism, including <em>The End of Magic and Climbing Chamundi Hill</em>, which was translated into many languages. His most important book was <em>Sacred Pain</em> (Oxford, 2001), written to explain the voluntary use of pain in religious life. <br />
<br />
Currently Glucklich is researching the likelihood that Iran and/or   Pakistan will use a nuclear weapon against Israel or India. He is   attempting to devise ways of thinking about undermining the culture of   collective suicide that makes rogue states so dangerous.

    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
	<p align="left"><em>Dying for Heaven</em> offers a groundbreaking theory of religion and   religious <span class="blacktext"><img src="../images/10-11/dyingforheaven.jpg" alt="Dying for Heaven" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></span>destructiveness; the book examines the motivations fueling   those who perpetrate religious violence around the globe—from Al Qaeda   and other Islamic terrorists to violent Hindu nationalists, from   Jewish-Zionist fundamentalists in Israel to leaders in Iran's race for   nuclear weapons, and to Christian messianic defenders of American power.   The continuing rise of religion as a global force and the proliferation   of nuclear weapons create a unique challenge for policy advisors, who   now must understand how far religious extremists will go toward nuclear   annihilation. <em>Dying for Heaven</em> provides the key for understanding   the religious drive to self-destruct and offers ways to combat the   culture of suicide terrorism. - from <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Dying-Heaven-Ariel-Glucklich/?isbn=9780061430817?AA=books_SearchBooks_24779">

    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book<img src="../images/10-11/1000Years.jpg" alt="1000 Years" width="160" height="269" align="right" /></h3>
    <p>"Brilliant and original, <em>A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</em> illuminates how mythology, history, and culture intersect with   personality to create fate. From the bustling heart of Beijing to a   fast-food restaurant in Chicago to the barren expanse of Inner Mongolia, <em>A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</em> reveals worlds both foreign and   familiar, with heartbreaking honesty and in beautiful prose.   &quot;Immortality,&quot; winner of The Paris Review  Plimpton Prize, tells the   story of a young man who bears a striking resemblance to a dictator and   so finds a calling to immortality. In &quot;Extra,&quot; the friendship between a   lonely Chinese woman and a young boy reveals how love can overcome   political and personal repression. In &quot;The Princess of Nebraska,&quot; a man   and a woman, both in exile, met at a Chicago restaurant and reminisced   about a young actor they had both been in love in Beijing. &quot;After A   Life&quot;  illuminates the vagaries of marriage, parenthood, and gender,   unfolding a story of a couple who keeps a daughter hidden from the world   for twenty-eight years. These and other stories form a mesmerizing   tapestry of revelatory fiction by an unforgettable writer." - from <a href="http://www.yiyunli.com/1000YearsBook.php">http://www.yiyunli.com/1000YearsBook.php</a></p>
