   <strong> Review of the Book:</strong> “It is hard to appreciate the terror and power of a major earthquake unless you have actually experienced it. However, this book comes as close as possible to taking the reader through such an experience, primarily by focussing in-depth on victims, namely several individuals and families, including bereavements. It was not ‘just’ a massive earthquake, for it led to a huge tsunami and potentially even worse damage in the form of leakage from a nuclear plant. Both the tsunami and the radioactive danger are also covered in detail, and in the latter case no punches are pulled. There is also detailed contextualisation, such as Japan’s history of earthquakes and tsunamis and their causes, the role of the Self-Defence Forces (and US forces) who assisted in the recovery, the politics involved, the media, the reactions of foreigners, and so forth. Birmingham and McNeill have done an excellent job in conveying the aftermath of a calamity. Let’s hope we learn from it.”--Kenneth Henshall, author of A History of Japan

    <h2><em>Smile as They Bow </em>by Nu Nu Yi </h2>
    <h3 class="blacktext"><img src="images/1516/smileastheybow2.png" alt="Max Brooks" width="282" height="424" class="author" />About the Author:</h3> 
    <p>Nu Nu Yi was born in 1957 in the village of Inwa near Mandalay; as Burmese customarily have no surnames, she affixes the village name as an identifying part of her pen name. Since her debut in 1984, she has written over fifteen novels, a hundred short stories, and various diaristic magazine articles. Now one of Myanmar's (Burma) leading writers, she currently resides in Yangon (Rangoon), although her writings are more often set among the rural poor and social outcasts. She has traveled abroad only briefly: once to the Oxford University Centre for Cross-Cultural Research on Women and once to the University of Iowa's International Writers' Program, as well as working with BBC World Radio in Chiang Mai to script Burmese language radio plays to promote HIV/AIDS awareness. </p>
 
    <h3 class="blacktext">Review About the Book:</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">
    
    <p> "Smile As They Bow." <em>PW Review Annex.</em> Publishers Weekly. (2008): 16. Web. 20 Jan. 2015. <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4013-0337-2">http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4013-0337-2</a></p>
    
    Myanmar novelist Yi, in her first work translated into English, gives a fascinating glimpse into the life of a gay, transvestite spirit medium caught up in a midlife crisis amid the currents of an annual summer Buddhist festival. A full array of pilgrims, along with their attendant pickpockets, musicians and peddlers, gather in the Burmese village of Taungbyon, eager to throw money at the various shrine natkadaws-mediums, mostly transvestites, who channel spirits known as nats. The narrative offers the stream-of-consciousness voices of several of these travel-worn festival visitors, but mainly dwells on the shrill sadness of one natkadaw in his fifties, Daisy Bond, weary of the obsequious wheedling that his job requires and terrified that Min Min, his bonded assistant of seven years, is going to leave him. A 16-year-old peasant when Daisy bought him from his mother, Min Min has become indispensable as Daisy's factotum, dresser, gofer and lover, but he's met a young street girl musician and is resolved to marry her. Yi convincingly portrays the bathos of Daisy's ludicrous gender-bending charade, though his mercenary quest for love is fully fleshed and affectingly portrayed.

    <h3 class="blacktext">Review About the Book</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">
    
    <p> Percy, Benjamin. "The Yellow Birds." <em>Esquire</em> 158.5 (2012): 46. <em>Academic Search Complete</em>. Web. 2 Oct. 2014</p>
    
    Twenty-one-year-old Private Bartle is our narrator. His mind is fragmented by battle and so is his story. He spins the reader through time and place, sometimes at boot camp, sometimes on rooftops bristling with rifles in Al Tafar, sometimes in a military prison where he scrapes the walls until they match the scarred nowhere of his mind. He cannot recover from his time overseas. He reaches for a rifle that isn't there. He sees the ghosts of lost soldiers everywhere. And he is haunted by a failed promise made: When he was deployed, he told the mother of his friend, 18-year-old Private Murphy, that he would keep the boy safe. Over the course of the novel, we slowly piece together the sickening details and learn the truth behind what happens to Murphy. Every sentence of The Yellow Birds (Little, Brown, $25) is something to marvel over, the words flashing and chiming like spent brass casings. Kevin Powers, who served as an Army machine gunner, has written one of the best books of the year, what could become the definitive novel about Iraq.
