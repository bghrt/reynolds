    <h3 class="blacktext">Review About the Book</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">
    
    <p> Percy, Benjamin. "The Yellow Birds." <em>Esquire</em> 158.5 (2012): 46. <em>Academic Search Complete</em>. Web. 2 Oct. 2014</p>
    
    Twenty-one-year-old Private Bartle is our narrator. His mind is fragmented by battle and so is his story. He spins the reader through time and place, sometimes at boot camp, sometimes on rooftops bristling with rifles in Al Tafar, sometimes in a military prison where he scrapes the walls until they match the scarred nowhere of his mind. He cannot recover from his time overseas. He reaches for a rifle that isn't there. He sees the ghosts of lost soldiers everywhere. And he is haunted by a failed promise made: When he was deployed, he told the mother of his friend, 18-year-old Private Murphy, that he would keep the boy safe. Over the course of the novel, we slowly piece together the sickening details and learn the truth behind what happens to Murphy. Every sentence of The Yellow Birds (Little, Brown, $25) is something to marvel over, the words flashing and chiming like spent brass casings. Kevin Powers, who served as an Army machine gunner, has written one of the best books of the year, what could become the definitive novel about Iraq.
