    <h3>The RALC in Outline - Take Three - 1985 - 1992 - Completing the First Twenty Years</h3>
    
    <p>Your self-appointed Historian and Resident Relic, Charter member Dr. John B. Trotti, herewith submits the third phase of our 
    	RALC History completing our first twenty years. This is a bare bones recounting of the facts as our minutes reflect them over 
        those years. Later Historians may comment on the weight and substance of what we have done here. Suffice it to say that our 
        libraries are closer, more cooperative, and stronger in this relationship than we were in 1972. Let it also be said that there 
        is much yet to be done to realize our potential.</p>

    <h3>Take Four: A History in Outline - 1993 – 2000</h3>
        <p>Submitted by Paul Porterfield <br/>
            Head, Media Resource Center <br/>
            Boatwright Memorial Library<br/>
            University of Richmond<br/>
            January 18, 2001</p>
    
        <p>This is a brief recounting of the minutes from RALC meetings. According to RALC by-laws, there are four scheduled meetings 
        in each calendar year. The meetings for which there were no available minutes are noted accordingly.</p>

	<h4>January 8, 1993; RALC at UTS</h4>
	<p>Bill Chamberlain (VCU) expressed a desire to move ahead with cooperative collection development. VSLA and VCU have very 
	  detailed materials selection policy. Dan Bedsole (RMC) inquired about the possible adoption by other libraries and asked about 
	  the possibility of VSLA taking leadership in this project. A committee was formed to look at the topic. RALC members were 
	  requested to look at the revisions to the bylaws and give its comments to Barbara Ford by early March. The reasons for the 
	  denial of the US Department of Education grant were outlined; the Richmond Area Film/Video Co-op  does not circulate outside of 
	  its membership; not a new service; greater staff or funding contribution needed; and not sufficient indication of the project. 
	  It was decided not to resubmit the proposal. There was a report from the Richmond Area Film/Video Co-op (Co-op). The Media 
	  Minder system will be moved to RMC. Media Minder was purchased by Brodart. An upgrade to the system with additional hardware 
	  would cost approximately $8,500. Bill Chamberlain moved that RALC look at alternative to the Media Minder system. A committee 
	  was formed to consider the costs, advantages, and disadvantages to securing another media cataloging system.</p>

	<h4>April 9, 1993; RALC at VSLA</h4>
	<p>The minutes of the January 8, 1993 meeting were clarified to show that RALC will purchase a new computer and an upgrade for 
	  the Media Minder system. The RALC treasurer presented the budget for the next fiscal year, reported that all annual dues had been 
	  collected, and stated that there was a budget balance of $7,055. It was decided that the revised RALC by-laws would be reviewed 
	  again and a vote taken to approve taken at the next meeting. The Collection Management Committee reported that they had met and 
	  discussed the possibilities of putting collection development policies on the VLIN database. They also asked RALC to provided a 
	  written charge for the committee. The Public Services Committee reported that it had met to discuss the problem of collecting 
	  overdues and fines from each other’s library in a timely manner. It was recommended that fees owed prior to 1992 be eliminated. 
	  Dan Bedsold (RMC) suggested that notification be give each semester, but clearance be done at the end of each academic year. The 
	  committee will develop a standard form and notification procedure. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that the new computer 
	  was installed at the end of January and the Media Minder upgrade received earlier in the week. Alternatives to Media Minder will 
	  continue to be explored. UTS expressed interest in purchasing the old Film/Video Co-op computer.</p>

	<h4>May 27, 1993; RALC at JTCC</h4>
	<p>The minutes of April 9, 1993, should indicate that Dan Bedsole (RMC) recommended that in RALC’s interlibrary loan guidelines 
	  an institution must be notified in a timely manner of any overdues or lost materials in order for the borrowing institution to 
	  reimburse the lending institution and that Mary Ann Bailey will bring recommendations to RALC. The Film/Video Co-op Committee 
	  reported that Media Minder was updated in April, 1993, and a training session is scheduled for June. Members should review the 
	  revised version of the bylaws and be ready to discuss and vote at the fall meeting. Dan Bedsole (RMC) distributed a draft of the 
	  charge for RALC’s Collection Development Committee. Discussion followed on whether or not to include libraries that are not part 
	  of RALC. It was felt that at first cooperative collection development activities should be limited to RALC members. Criteria to 
	  be considered in determining membership in RALC were given as size of collection, budget, quality of collection, location of main 
	  campus, and geographic relationship to Richmond. Eike Heuter (RBC) moved to approve the charge. It was approved unanimously.</p>

	<h4>October 1, 1993; RALC at VSU</h4>
	<p>The treasurer reported that RALC is now earning interest on its Money Market savings account. He also informed the membership 
	  that committee budgets did not carry over from one fiscal year to the next. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that there 
	  had been technical difficulty with Media Minder. The annual Film/Video collection requirements were discussed. It was decided 
	  that the minimum media collection budget for member schools should be the number of titles borrowed times $15. The Technical 
	  Services Committee will report on Media Minder at the January RALC meeting. The Public Services Committee reported that it met 
	  to discuss the RALC pass and overdue lists. A uniform RALC pass is being developed by the committee for implementation in January 
	  1994. It was moved and approved that Public Services develop and produce a uniform RALC pass with a January implementation date. 
	  The committee recommended that an overdue list be generated by April 15 and November 15 in order to provide each institution with 
	  enough time to clear book debts. A needs and interest survey is being developed for the staff exchange program. Vote on the 
	  revisions to the bylaws was delayed until January.</p>

	<h4>October 9, 1993; RALC at MCV/VCU</h4>
	<p>It was reported again that RALC was not awarded a Department of Education grant for the online media catalog project. RALC 
	  did not feel that it was able to share it resources beyond its members and for that reason outside funding will be difficult to 
	  obtain. The RALC directors acknowledged the excellent work done by Kathy Fladland, Catalog Librarian at VCU, who was responsible 
	  for preparing the proposal. Barbara Ford and Paul Porterfield visited the Richmond campus library of Commonwealth College. There 
	  are libraries on five separate campuses. SACS is considering accreditation for the college. Barbara Ford raised the issue of 
	  membership criteria and the implications of distance education in the Richmond area. After learning about Commonwealth College 
	  and its libraries, it was the sense of the RALC directors that membership would not be appropriate. Vonita Dandridge (VUU) will 
	  review the bylaws with particular attention to the membership criteria and submit a proposed revision for the next meeting. 
	  Judith Hunt (UR) requested the members consider a donation to the libraries in the Miami area that had been damaged by Hurricane 
	  Andrew. It was recommended that each individual and/or each library donate as they wish.</p>

	<h4>April 8, 1994; RALC at RMC</h4>
	<p>The treasurer reported that RALC’s budget balance is $6,405.93. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that a lack of 
	  consistent technologies at member libraries is perceived as a difficulty in implementing anything other than print versions of 
	  the film/video catalog. John Duke (VCU) suggested the Z39 link software that enables you to search another catalog and provides 
	  displays in format of searcher’s software. OCLC was also seen as a possibility, however, libraries would have to conduct searches. 
	  After much discussion the committee agreed to use the existing Media Minder system for next year and study what format is best 
	  for distribution of the catalog to all members.</p>

	<h4>June 2, 1994; RALC at RBC</h4>
	<p>The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported and distributed the results of a survey conducted to identify technology available in 
	  the Co-op. This preliminary information was needed to determine the format of future film/video catalogs. An ad-hoc committee of 
	  media and technical services members will conduct a major assessment of the Co-op to review its mission, structure, and goals. 
	  This mini self study will answer such questions as: (1) Are current objectives being addressed and (2) How will we continue to 
	  implement and enhance resource sharing.</p>

	<h4>October 2, 1994; RALC at SVCC</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer reported that the RALC budget balance is over $8,000, including the UR account and the RALC money market 
	  savings account. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that borrowing among member schools has shown a significant increase 
	  over the past several years. Paul Porterfield (UR) raised several questions: (1) Whether or not the Co-op can continue as an 
	  entity with such heavy demand increasing the workload at member schools? (2) Should schools own their own much-used videos 
	  considering that video costs had gone down? (3) Is the cost of running the shuttle effective with maintenance and staffing 
	  problems? Problems related to the film catalog were also discussed. Chuck Ormsbee (RMC) reported that the printed catalog may 
	  not be produced because of time and staffing constraints. It was decided by the RALC directors to hire a part-time cataloger to 
	  catalog the past year’s media purchases. The final draft of the bylaws was passed out for consideration. A change was made in the 
	  section related to criteria for accepting new RALC members. The acceptance of a new member of RALC must receive two thirds of the 
	  member institutions. The bylaws will be voted on at the next meeting. Those present then watched a video and slide presentation by
	  Judith Hunt (UR) of her trip to IFLA in Havanna.</p>

	<h4>January 13, 1995 (Incomplete minutes available)</h4>
	<p>The revised bylaws were approved by the members present.</p>

	<h4>May 10, 1995; RALC at RMC</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer presented the budget for fiscal year 1995/96 and stated that the major change was an increase in charges 
	  for the shuttle service provided by the University of Richmond, VCU, and Virginia State University. The Film/Video Co-op Committee 
	  reported that the new film/video catalog was being distributed and that the fate of the Media Minder system used to prepare the 
	  catalog was uncertain at this time. Ann Knox (UTS) circulated a summary document of the results of the Cooperative Committee’s 
	  survey of the membership. She also reported on the recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on the future of the Film/Video Co-op. 
	  Problems with staff workloads, shuttle van staffing, and the deteriorating physical condition of the UR shuttle van were principal 
	  concerns in the document. A recommendation that RALC consider hiring a part-time person who would be responsible for bookings, 
	  database maintenance, and driving the shuttle van was presented as a possibility to consider. A special RALC committee was 
	  appointed to review the recommendations of the Ad-Hoc Committee and report back to the RALC directors by fall, 1995. Sara 
	  Watstein (VCU) reported that the Public Services Committee has assumed the responsibilities of the defunct Cooperative 
	  Collection Development Committee.</p>

	<h4>Summer, 1995; (No minutes available)</h4>

	<h4>Fall, 1995; (No minutes available)</h4>

	<h4>January, 23, 1995 (Incomplete minutes available)</h4>
	<p>A discussion was held of possible changes in the Film/Video Co-op shuttle service (i.e.; use of U.S. Mail, use of UPS, etc.). 
	  Suggestions were discussed for using RALC monies for technology purchases.</p>

	<h4>April 19, 1996; RALC at UR</h4>
	<p>Elsie Stephens Weatherington (VSU) reported that Gay Neale had resigned the membership of Southside Community College due to 
	  other obligations. The RALC treasurer gave the annual budget report and it was approved along with dues for next year. The 
	  Technical Services Committee reported on the upcoming SOLINET workshop. Additional funds were approved by RALC to send members 
	  to the workshop. The Public Services Committee reported on the successful copyright workshop that was held at UR earlier in the 
	  month. The possibility of creating a homepage for RALC was discussed by the RALC directors. The Film/Video Co-op Committee 
	  reported that the new formula for determining library media budgets was to be the number of items borrowed from the Co-op X 
	  $20.00. Paul Porterfield (UR) reported on his negotiations as RALC treasurer with Professional Freight to provide courier service 
	  for media and other ILL materials for RALC. This service will replace the old shuttle service provided by UR, VCU, and VSU. The 
	  courier service will be used for one year and evaluated. The RALC directors unanimously approved the contract with Professional 
	  Freight be signed for the coming fiscal year.</p>

	<h4>October 25, 1996; RALC at VSU</h4>
	<p>The Public Services Committee recommended that they work with the Film/Video Co-op Committee to formulate guidelines for loans. 
	  Some institutions loan media and some do not. It was suggested to include media with interlibrary loan policies. The Film/Video 
	  Co-op Committee recommended that Public Services and the Film/Video Co-op prepare a survey to address the way lending is 
	  structured at each institution and look at what materials are borrowed. It was reported that there have been minimal problems 
	  with the courier services instituted in July. Gary Graham (JTCC) addressed the future of the Film/Video Co-op. The discussion 
	  elicited the following observation: borrowing has decreased by 20% partly due to the lack of a current printed catalog of 
	  resources and partly due to some institutions being less dependent upon the Film/Video Co-op. Discussion was directed to 
	  creating a homepage for RALC and possibly linking films titles to the homepage.</p>

	<h4>January 17, 1997; RALC at RBC</h4>
	<p>The Public Services Committee reported that Dan Ream (VCU) did a presentation at VCU on teaching the Internet. A subcommittee 
	  was appointed to work with Nell Chenault (VCU), chair of the Film/Video Co-op Committee, to survey libraries and their lending 
	  policies. Nell reported that the cost of the courier service was very economical in comparison with other means of ILL delivery. 
	  John Duke (VCU) offered to explore a way to search everyone’s listing of audio-visual materials since the printed catalog is no 
	  longer available.</p>

	<h4>April 25, 1997; RALC at VUU</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer presented the budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year which was approved by the members. It was reported that 
	  more monies were being made available for staff development programs and workshops. Committees must submit a proposed budget for 
	  any staff development they wish to present. The treasurer, in consultation with the RALC chair, will approve theses budgets 
	  requests. The Technical Services Committee reported on the upcoming workshop "The Management of Electronic Serials." The Public 
	  Services Committee reported on a program presented at UTS by Dr. Gary Lamburth, Human Resources Director at RMC, on motivation 
	  and doing more with less. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that a change in the courier delivery service would allow for 
	  a second stop at VCU each delivery day. Nell Chenault (VCU) distributed handouts on the VLA/RALC program scheduled for May 30 at 
	  UR entitled "To Lend or Not to Lend Nonprint Media".</p>

	<h4>July 18, 1997; RALC at UTS</h4>
	<p>The Technical Services Committee reported on the workshop held at UVA on cataloging electronic resources. RALC sponsored 10 of 
	  its members to attend this very useful workshop. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that the ILL courier service would now 
	  make one stop at the Library of Virginia and two stops at VCU. The program "To Lend or Not to Lend Non-Print Materials/Current 
	  Practices &amp; Pending Copyright Changes" was held at UR with 15 media staff and 30 VLA attendees present. Paul Porterfield (UR) and 
	  Nell Chenaulty (VCU) will develop new forms for requesting monies for workshops and evaluating the program. Gary Graham (JTCC) 
	  discussed the funds balance and the activity generated by the courier service. In the absence of a printed catalog, we need to 
	  address how we can determine the media holdings of each library. Also, the libraries need to work on entering all of their media 
	  holdings in their individual online catalogs. Barbara Ford (VCU) reminded the members that this has been an ongoing project and 
	  that action needs to be taken to solve the problem of accessing each library’s media holdings. A committee was formed to make 
	  recommendations to RALC on how to provide an online catalog of media materials. Discussion was directed again to considering the 
	  development of a website for RALC. VSU and Reynolds both offered to work on this project. Kip Campbell (Library of VA) asked about 
	  the possibility of a statewide meeting of library consortia.</p>

	<h4>October 17, 1997; RALC at JTCC</h4>
	<p>The purpose of the RALC homepage was discussed. The primary purposes are marketing, public relations, keeping up-to-date, and 
	  serving as an archival resource. Virginia Cherry discussed sending RALC minutes via e-mail for approval and then forwarding them 
	  to Hong Wu (Reynolds) to be placed on the homepage. However, it was decided by the members to continue sending printed minutes by 
	  courier for approval. A discussion of the Statewide meeting of all consortia in the Commonwealth by Kip Campbell (Library of VA) 
	  will be presented at the January meeting of RALC. The members then moved to the John Tyler Collaborative Learning Center for a 
	  demonstration of the Z39.50 software by Mike Burgmeier (VCU) and a presentation of the homepage by Hong Wu (Reynolds).</p>

	<h4>January 23, 1998; RALC at UR</h4>
	<p>The Public Services Committee held their last meeting at Virginia Union where they were toured around the new library. Mike 
	  Burgmeier distributed a brief outline on the Z39.50 software options for an online media catalog. DRA Web appears to be the ideal 
	  product for the Film/Video Co-op’s needs. The cost is $5,000 per user. It was decided to have the DRA sales representative meet 
	  with the Film/Video Co-op Committee and make a demonstration of the product. Hong Wu (Reynolds) handed out copies of the new RALC 
	  homepage and explained each link. The history link is not yet complete and the suggestion was made to ask Dr. Trotti (UTS) to 
	  continue his good work. It was suggested that all members look at the RALC homepage and notify Hong Wu of any changes needed. 
	  Gary Graham (JTCC) speaking on behalf of RALC’s executive committee that a 16mm film center reside at VCU. RALC members would 
	  pass ownership of their 16mm films to VCU so as to centralize storage and preservation efforts. Dan Bedsole (RMC) agreed with the 
	  concept for a majority of films, but stated that certain faculty may not agree to give up possession of heavily used films. 
	  Barbara Ford (VCU) stated that VCU would accept the films as a standard gift with the option to weed the collection in the future. 
	  Gary Graham suggested the topic be put on the agenda for discussion at the next meeting at which time he will present a draft of a 
	  possible policy.</p>

	<h4>April 21, 1998; RALC at RMC</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer reviewed the 1998 budget and the 1999 budget recommendation. The budget report was approved. The Film/Video 
	  Co-op Committee reported that each school was encouraged to send up to five film title per week to VCU for cleaning and 
	  inspection. The cost of film cleaning is covered in the RALC dues. The Technical Services Committee reported that a workshop, 
	  "Tracking a Moving Target: Internet Resources in the Online Catalog", is being planned. The RALC webmaster distributed a copy of 
	  the homepage and requested members to review the information and notify her of any corrections, changes, and/or suggestions. Mike 
	  Burgmeier (VCU) shared information regarding the March 18th demonstration of DRA’s proposed RALC media search package. There was 
	  difficulty in connecting, but it is an acceptable product and will do what is needed. However, because of the costs involved for 
	  training and maintenance VCU will not be manage the project. The RALC Executive Committee will meet with Mike Burgmeier to discuss 
	  the SIRSI product. It was announced that a planning meeting/workshop addressing the concerns of consortia throughout the state is 
	  scheduled for June 6.</p>

	<h4>July 17, 1998; RALC at RBC</h4>
	<p>Jim Rettig was introduced at the new University Librarian at UR. It was agreed that the correct acronym for the Library of 
	  Virginia would be "LVA." The Public Services Committee reported that the workshop "Delivering Library Services for Distance 
	  Learning" was a success. It was suggested that Public Services prepare a survey to see what types of workshops would be inviting. 
	  These surveys would be distributed by the RALC directors to their library faculty and staff. Paul Porterfield (UR), RALC 
	  treasurer, announced that there would be $2,400 for the committees to use on staff development programs. Committees may submit 
	  requests for honorariums as part of their program budget request. Mike Burgmeier (VCU) was unable to attend the meeting, but Gary 
	  Graham reported that Mike has configured all but three libraries for the Vizion software for the media online catalog. It was 
	  reported that the Library of Virginia and RALC are co-sponsoring a session at the VLA meeting in October. The session will 
	  "Consortia-Resource Sharing for the Future" is on the consortia in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>

	<h4>October 9, 1998; RALC at UR</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer reported that all outstanding bills had been paid for staff development workshops. The Technical Services 
	  Committee reported that its last meeting was held at LVA on June 12, 1998, and that the attendees toured the new facility. The 
	  Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that its annual statistics had been compiled and would be placed on the RALC homepage. It 
	  was announced that there will be a panel discussion sponsored by RALC at the VLA/VEMA Conference on October 17, 1998. It was also 
	  announced that because Mike Burgmeier is departing VCU the Film/Video Co-op must begin anew in investigating solutions in 
	  providing a online media catalog. Paul Porterfield (UR) suggested hiring a consultant to investigate problems and Z39.50 
	  compliance. A discussion was held about net lenders and the LVA no longer reimbursing colleges and universities. However, 
	  VIVA will compensate libraries which do not charge other libraries. The feasibility of a universal library card was discussed by 
	  Gary Graham (JTCC). John Trotti (UTS) inquired about whether or not members are compiling lists of discontinued or dropped 
	  periodicals for consortium members. The response was negative. Gary Graham (JTCC) announced that he will have a suite at the 
	  VLA/VEMA Conference for RALC directors and their staffs.</p>

	<h4>January 22, 1999; RALC at JTCC</h4>
    <p>The RALC treasurer asked that all committees submit budget requests prior to the Director’s meeting scheduled for April, 1999. 
      The Technical Services Committee reported that they met on November 6, 1998 at RBC. Information was shared regarding cataloging 
      electronic resources. The Public Services Committee reported that they met on October 30, 1998. The members discussed surveying 
      librarians and staff to determine what training is needed in planning workshops. A questionnaire has been designed and distributed 
      to directors to distribute to librarians and staff. The Film/Video Co-op Committee distributed last year’s statistics. Figures 
      will be provided to each director containing information on the past 3-5 years to analyze Co-op effectiveness. Paul Porterfield 
      (UR) announced that UR would week it 16mm film collection and send them to VCU.</p>

	<h4>April 23, 1999; RALC at RMC</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer presented the recommended budget for FY2000 which was subsequently approved by the RALC directors. The 
	  Public Services Committee requested that ILL statistics be turned in by all schools. Paul Porterfield (UR) reported that UR had 
	  weeded 240 16mm films from its collection. (A list of titles will be provided to all member schools.) Films will be sent to any 
	  school that requests them. The reminder will be sent to VCU.</p>

	<h4>August 6, 1999; RALC at RBC</h4>
	<p>Jim Rettig gave the budget report for the RALC treasurer: all dues statements have gone out and payments are being received. 
	  The Technical Services Committee reported that scholarships were provided for ten attendees of the FLA TSAR spring workshop, "A 
	  PERL Toolkit for Libraries." About 80 people attended the workshop. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported statistics for 
	  1997/98. Co-op loaning and borrowing statistics are down while use of a school’s own collection is up. The question is whether or 
	  not to continue with the courier service ($10,000+ per year) if the use of the Co-op continues to go down. The consideration of 
	  hiring a consultant to investigate search engines for accessing media holdings was discussed. The homepage needs to reflect the 
	  changes in terms of office for RALC officers. The chair of RALC will now serve a two-year term. This correction will be made in 
	  the bylaws. The members at this meeting strongly recommended that we revisit the mission of RALC at our next meeting. VIVA and 
	  ILL through OCLC are duplicating many of our efforts. The following are some of the thoughts presented:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Do we have a mission any longer?</li>
		<li>Examine usefulness of present RALC committees, combine, eliminate?</li>
		<li>Get away from books and be mostly film/video lenders.</li>
		<li>Use our bank account to serve our membership.</li>
   		<li>Focus more on professional development.</li>
   		<li>Have a more active paraprofessional forum.</li>
   		<li>Create a committee to plan and set up workshops that would be composed of representatives from the other committees.</li>
   		<li>Put deadlines on reports.</li>
   		<li>Discuss issues with staff.</li>
   </ol>

	<h4>October 15, 1999; RALC at VUU</h4>
	<p>John Ulmschneider, the new Executive Director of University Library Services at VCU, was welcomed. The RALC treasurer reported 
	  that all dues had been collected for the fiscal year. The need for a union catalog was discussed. All members have Z39.50. If 
	  someone’s catalog could search all members’ catalogs they could host the union catalog. It is recommended that RALC needs to 
	  conduct a test of Z39.50 for each member. A committee needs to be set up to investigate. It was suggested that the chair of this 
	  committee be Gene Damon (Director of Library Automation and Learning Resources for the Virginia Community College System. Hung Wu, 
	  Webmaster, presented recommended changes to button categories on the RALC homepage. A change to the "Officers" section of the 
	  bylaws has been presented that would stagger the office terms of the President and Vice-President/President-Elect. The 
	  Vice-President/President-Elect would be elected in April of the first year of the President’s two-year term. It was suggested 
	  that Elsie Stephens-Wetherington (VSU) and Jim Rettig (UR) for and co-chair a committee to reconsider the mission of RALC. 
	  The Board would like this committee to have something to report at the next meeting. Jim Rettig has suggested the creation of 
	  a listserv. Each institution can put forth the names of members to be part of the listserv.</p>

	<h4>January 21, 2000; RALC at JTCC</h4>
    <p>The RALC treasurer reported via e-mail that the only business since the last meeting is the payment for the teleconference 
      "Libraries, Copyright, and the Internet." UR will pay $125 and RALC will pay $150. Copies of the background information on the 
      teleconference were distributed. The Film/Video Co-op Committee requested that Co-op statistics be reported promptly. John Duke 
      (VCU) suggested that the Future of RALC Committee should look at what RALC can do that is not being done for us by other 
      consortiums. Library directors were reminded to send a representative to the RALC Directors’ meeting if they are unable to 
      attend. John Duke (VCU) volunteered to serve on the Online Catalog Search Engine Committee. It was recommended that Charles 
      Lewis, Nancy Brantley, Tom Campagnoli, and Elizabeth Sudduth also serve on the committee.</p>

	<h4>April 13, 2000; RALC at UR</h4>
	<p>It was announced that Union Theological Seminary had changed its name to Union-Presbyterian School of Christian Education. 
	  The RALC treasurer reviewed the expenditures of the 2000 budget and presented the 2001 budget proposal. The 2001 budget proposal 
	  was approved by the members present. John Ulmschneider (VCU) made a motion to endorse a subcommittee of directors to make 
	  recommendations in implementing an internship/scholarship program to provide funding for graduate students in library science to 
	  work closely with RALC institutions. The motion was seconded and approved. The committee members are John Ulmschneider, 
	  Jim Rettig, and Ginger Young. It was announced that the RALC treasurer will send copies of the American Association of Law 
	  Libraries Videoconference "Books and Bytes…" to all members of RALC. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that the ILL 
	  courier service would continue to run two times per week. Statistics for films and videos are decreasing because of the 
	  out-of-date catalog. 16mm films should be cleaned at least once every two years. VCU is assisting members schools to accomplish 
	  this task. Elsie Stephens-Weatherington requested that members submit suggestions on improving RALC to her or Jim Rettig (UR).</p>

	<h4>June 15, 2000; RALC at RBC</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer reported that the contract with Professional Freight has been continued for another year at the same rate 
	  as last year. The terms of the courier service will remain the same (two deliveries a week). The Technical Services Committee 
	  reported that there was a two-day workshop held at the Library of Virginia, "Fundamentals of Book Repair." The sessions were 
	  very good and paid for by RALC. The User Services Committee met at VCU on May 24. Possible future workshops were discussed at the 
	  meeting. John Ulmschneider is working on initiative and investigating all possibilities for RALC’s Internship/Scholarship program. 
	  He will specifically discuss options with representatives at the University of Tennessee and Catholic University.</p>

	<h4>October 12, 2000; RALC at VSU</h4>
	<p>The RALC treasurer reported that most of the dues had been collected for the fiscal year. He reminded everyone to send in 
	  evaluations after a RALC workshop. The Technical Services Committee reported that the "Fundamentals of Book Repair" workshop by 
	  SOLINET held at the Library of Virginia was a great success. 18 people (6 from RALC0 participated in the workshop. It was 
	  proposed that the "Intermediate Book Repair" workshop be held at RBC. The Public Services Committee reported that the workshop 
	  "E-Reserves, Copyright, and UCITA" was held Oct. 6, 2000 at RMC. Ruth Kifer, Associate University Librarian for Distributed 
	  Libraries at George Mason University, led the workshop. 22 participants attended the workshop. The number of RALC institutions 
	  represented was 8. The Film/Video Co-op Committee reported that about half of the schools had reported Co-op statistics for the 
	  year. It was suggested that e-mails be sent to directors in order to follow up in obtaining the statistics. A discussion followed 
	  that the Public Services should be collecting ILL use of the courier statistics. John Ulmschneider (VCU) has identified the 
	  University of Tennessee and Catholic University as having library programs in the Commonwealth. RALC will need to define the 
	  parameters for awarding the scholarship, i.e.; levels of support, eligibility, etc. Elsie Stephens-Weatherington and Jim Rettig 
	  had suggested that a survey be utilized in order to obtain issues/questions about the future of RALC. The group agreed that it 
	  would be better to have our January 18 meeting as a retreat rather than sending a survey. John Ulmschneider reported that we 
	  will have the capability to search member libraries in the near future. He will have a form sent to each of our libraries asking 
	  for IP address of our Z39.50 server, port assignments; databases, etc. in order to facilitate this project. Bryant &amp; Statton 
	  College in Chesterfield County requested via e-mail to join RALC. This request was denied according to the criteria spelled out 
	  in the RALC bylaws. Virginia Cherry (RBC) will notify Bryant &amp; Statton College. Paul Porterfield (UR) referred everyone to the 
	  new copyright webpage at the University of Richmond. It was suggested that links to each schools copyright pages be available on the 
	  RALC homepage as well as other copyright URLs.</p>
