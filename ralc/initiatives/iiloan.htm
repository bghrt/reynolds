<h1>Interinstitutional Loan Agreement</h1>
	<p>March 1990, Revised 4/2001, Revised 1/29/2008</p>

	<p>The members of the Richmond Academic Library Consortium (RALC) make this Interinstitutional Loan Agreement to promote 
	  sharing of library resources within RALC. The members of RALC (with their respective OCLC symbols) are:
	  <ul>
       	  <li><span class="bold">PZK</span> J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College: (Downtown Campus)</li>
          <li><span class="bold">PZL</span> J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College: (Parham Campus)</li>
          <li><span class="bold">PZM</span> J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College: (Goochland Campus)</li>
          <li><span class="bold">PZN</span> John Tyler Community College</li>
          <li><span class="bold">VRL</span> University of Richmond Law Library</li>
          <li><span class="bold">VRM</span> Randolph-Macon College</li>
          <li><span class="bold">VRC</span> Virginia Commonwealth University</li>
          <li><span class="bold">PZC</span> Richard Bland College</li>
		  <li><span class="bold">VIC</span> Library of Virginia</li>
		  <li><span class="bold">VUT</span> Union-PSCE</li>
		  <li><span class="bold">VSC</span> Virginia State University</li>
		  <li><span class="bold">VRU</span> University of Richmond</li>
		  <li><span class="bold">VUU</span> Virginia Union University</li>
        </ul>
   
   <ol>
   		<li><h2>General Guidelines</h2>
        	<ol type="A">
            	<li>The RALC Public Services Committee will review this agreement annually, and recommendations for change will be 
            	forwarded to the RALC Directors.</li>
                <li>It is recognized that participating libraries will, from time to time, have internal pressures that will deny 
                the loan of certain materials (such as reserve books, bound journals, special collections, or material in poor condition). 
                However, each library will be as generous and responsive as possible. </li>
				<li>Every effort will be made to return material on time to the lending library. The lending library will send overdue 
                notices and billings directly to the borrowing library for material borrowed either through interlibrary loan or by 
                institutional pass. The borrowing library is responsible for notifying patrons of overdue material. The borrowing library 
                has final responsibility for any material borrowed for or by its patrons. Should material be lost or damaged, the 
                borrowing library is responsible for reimbursing the lending library for the replacement and processing costs, as 
                determined by the lending library. The lending library is responsible for notifying the borrowing library of material 
                that is not returned promptly. The lending library will notify the borrowing library of charges for lost books and other 
                outstanding balances by November 15 for the Fall semester and April 15 for the Spring semester.</li>
				<li>Before issuing the interinstitutional borrowing pass, the borrowing library will determine whether or not it 
                owns the material. If it does not own the material (or it is not available), the borrowing library will verify that a 
                RALC library owns the material before sending an ILL request or patron. The patron is responsible for checking the 
                actual availability of the item upon visiting the lending library. Ownership does not guarantee availability.</li>
               	<li>The lending library's policies and procedures will apply in all matters not specifically mentioned in this 
                agreement.</li>
                <li>These policies are minimal guidelines, which may be exceeded by mutual agreement between individual borrowing and 
                lending libraries on a case-by-case basis.</li>
            </ol></li>

	<li><h2>Interlibrary Loan</h2>
	        <ol type="A">

            	<li>RALC libraries agree to request interlibrary loan materials via OCLC. The requesting library will use the OCLC 
                "affiliation line" to note that this is a RALC request. ALA forms may be used if there is a problem with OCLC access.</li>
               	<li>In accordance with VIVA guidelines, most items will be loaned for eight weeks use with no renewals. Some non-book 
                materials may have shorter loan periods at the discretion of the lending library.  Books may be recalled for the use of 
                one of the lending institution's primary users whenever necessary.</li>
				<li>The number of books loaned will be determined by the lending library.</li>
                <li>The <a href="shuttle.htm">intercampus shuttle</a> is to be used to transport materials between RALC libraries.</li>
				<li>The lending library will attempt to supply photocopies via ARIEL (preferred) or fax.  Photocopies may be sent by 
                the next  shuttle, if their content or volume prohibits transmission via ARIEL or fax.</li>
                <li>Further information is available in individual institution interlibrary loan policies and in the Virginia 
                Interlibrary Loan Code. </li>
            </ol></li>

    <li><h2>Interinstitutional Passes</h2>
    		<ol type="A">
            	<li>RALC libraries agree to loan books directly to undergraduates, graduate students, staff, and faculty at other 
                RALC libraries free of charge. </li>
                <li>Undergraduates and graduate students will be required to present a pass to borrow directly from a RALC library. 
                These passes are obtained from the patron's academic institution. The student's or staff member's home institution 
                will set its own policies for issuing such passes.</li>
                <li>Faculty and staff members may use their own institution's identification cards (or other appropriate institutional 
                identification) to borrow books. The lending library may require that RALC borrowers also obtain a library card 
                issued by the lending institution before borrowing materials.</li>
                <li>Books will be loaned for a minimum of 3 weeks, with renewal subject to the lending institution's policies and 
                item availability.</li>
                <li>A minimum of five books will be loaned at one time to staff members, undergraduates, graduate students and 
                faculty.</li>
           </ol><br />
