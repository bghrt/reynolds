     <h1> Video and Interlibrary Loan Survey</h1>
     <p>Submitted by Shirley R. Thomas, Resource and Delivery Services at VCU Libraries</p>
     <p>10/2003</p>

 	 <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Last fall, VCU Libraries merged some Resource Delivery Services (RDS) functions with its Circulation and Information Services 
     (CIS) at Cabell Library.  This merger centralized the initial borrowing processing (searching, ordering and renewing) at the 
     Tompkins-McCaw Library.  The new centralized borrowing team noted that requests for videos submitted to RALC institutions were 
     sometimes filled by the ILL departments from the Film/Cooperative Collections at lending RALC institutions and were sometimes 
     cancelled. Institutions that cancelled VCU requests asked that they be resubmitted through VCU Media Resource Services.</p>
	
     <h2>Purpose</h2>
     <p>The following email message was sent on April 23, 2003 to the RALC List to streamline video borrowing request submission 
     procedures at VCU Libraries.</p>
     <p>We are interested in identifying RALC libraries that will accept interlibrary loan requests for videos.</p>
     <p>You may send your responses directly to me and I will summarize for the list.  If you are not the person who can respond, 
     please share this message with the staff that may be able to answer.</p>
     
     <h2>Results</h2>
     <p>Eight RALC institutions responded to the email message.  Some respondents asked for further clarification and some indicated 
     concerns that the above message was suggesting a change in RALC Co-Op video booking and delivery services.  Below is a summary 
     of the responses.</p>
     
     <h3>Responses:</h3>
     	<ul>
        	<li>3 - Forward requests for videos to Media for processing.</li>
            <li>3 - Accept ILL requests for videos.  They will not lend if on reserve, anticipate heavy local use or heavy RALC 
            traffic.</li>
            <li>2 - Cancel ILL requests for videos.  Requests must be submitted through the Media Co-op.</li>
        </ul>
     
     <h2>Findings</h2>
     <p>At least one institution preferred receiving video requests through OCLC because it increases their OCLC lending statistics.  
     VIVA funding for resource sharing is based on the OCLC interlibrary loan lending statistics.  Thus, higher OCLC lending 
     statistics means more funding.</p>
     <p>Video collections vary greatly in size and how they are managed.  Staff managing small collections have dual roles within 
     their organizations and seem to be able to manage processing ILL requests from RALC institutions.  Not all RALC institutions 
     have video collections other than the Media Co-op collections.</p>
