    <h2><em>World War Z </em>by Max Brooks</h2>
    <h3 class="blacktext"><img src="../images/12-13/max-brooks.jpg" alt="Max Brooks" width="220" height="309" class="author" />About the Author</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">The son of actor and comedian Mel Brooks and actress Anne Bancroft, &quot;Max Brooks is the author of the two bestsellers &quot;The Zombie Survival   Guide&quot; and &quot;World War Z&quot;. He has also written for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;,   for which he won an Emmy. His new graphic novel &quot;The Zombie Survival   Guide: Recorded Attacks&quot; will be released in October of 09.  &quot; - from <a href="http://maxbrooks.com/bio.php">http://maxbrooks.com/bio.php</a></p>
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
    <p class="blacktext">&quot;The  Crisis&quot; nearly wiped out humanity. Max Brooks (son of Mel Brooks and  author of <em>The Zombie Survival Guide,</em> 2003) has taken it upon himself to  document the &quot;firsthand&quot; experiences and testimonies of those lucky  to survive 10 years after the fictitious zombie war. <em><img src="../images/12-13/wwz.gif" width="201" height="306" alt="World War Z" align="right"/></em>Like a horror fan's  version of Studs Terkel's <em>The Good War</em> (1984), the &quot;historical  account&quot; format gives Brooks room to explore the zombie plague from  numerous different views and characters. In a deadpan voice, Brooks exhaustively  details zombie incidents from isolated attacks to full-scale military combat:  &quot;what if the enemy can't be shocked and awed? Not just won't, but  biologically can't!&quot; With the exception of a weak <em>BAT-21</em> story in  the second act, the &quot;interviews&quot; and personal accounts capture the  universal fear of the collapse of society--a living nightmare in which anyone  can become a mindless, insatiable predator at a moment's notice. Alas, Brad  Pitt's production company has purchased the film rights to the book--while it does  have a chronological element, it's more similar to a collection of short  stories: it would make for an excellent <em>24</em>-style TV series or an  animated serial. Regardless, horror fans won't be disappointed: like George  Romero's <em>Dead </em>trilogy, <em>World War Z</em> is another milestone in the  zombie mythos.&quot; <em>Carlos Orellana</em>, Booklist Review<br />

    <h2><em>The Illustrated Man </em>by Ray Bradbury</h2>
    <h3><img src="../images/12-13/bradbury.jpg" alt="Ray Bradbury" width="200" height="258" class="author" /><span class="blacktext">About the Author</span></h3>
    <p>&quot;<strong>Ray Bradbury</strong> is one of those rare individuals whose writing has   changed the way people think. His more than five hundred published works   -- short stories, novels, plays, screenplays, television scripts, and   verse -- exemplify the American imagination at its most creative. <br />
      <br />
      Once read, his words are never forgotten. His best-known and most   beloved books, THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, THE ILLUSTRATED MAN, FAHRENHEIT   451 and SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, are masterworks that readers   carry with them over a lifetime. His timeless, constant appeal to   audiences young and old has proven him to be one of the truly classic   authors of the 20th Century -- and the 21st.&quot; - from <a href="http://www.raybradbury.com/about.html">raybradbury.com</a></p>
    <h3 class="blacktext">&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book<img src="../images/12-13/illustrated-man.jpg" width="164" height="280" alt="The Illustrated Man" align="right"/></h3>
    <p class="blacktext">&quot;That <em>The Illustrated Man</em> has remained in print since being  published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's  work. Only his second collection (the first was <em>Dark Carnival</em>, later  reworked into <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034532448X/$%7B0%7D">The October  Country</a></em>), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction,  fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book,  Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated  Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's  even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations  are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such  as &quot;The Veldt,&quot; wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality  way over the edge. Or &quot;Kaleidoscope,&quot; a heartbreaking portrait of  stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a  spaceship. Or &quot;Zero Hour,&quot; in which invading aliens have discovered a  most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s  and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50  years from now.&quot; <em>--Stanley Wiater</em></p>

    <h2> <em>Behind the Beautiful Forevers</em> by Katherine Boo</h2>
    <h3 class="blacktext"><img src="../images/12-13/katherine-boo.jpg" alt="Katherine Boo" width="268" height="276" class="author" />About the Author</h3>
    <p><strong>&quot;Katherine Boo</strong> is a staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> and a former reporter and editor for <em>The Washington Post</em>. She learned to report at the alternative weekly, <em>Washington City Pape</em>r, after which she worked as a writer and co-editor of <em>The Washington Monthly</em> magazine. Over the years, her reporting from disadvantaged   communities has been awarded a Pulitzer Prize, a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius&rdquo;   grant, and a National Magazine Award for Feature Writing. For the last   decade, she has divided her time between the United States and India,   the birthplace of her husband, Sunil Khilnani. This is her first book.&quot; - from <a href="http://www.behindthebeautifulforevers.com/author/">http://www.behindthebeautifulforevers.com/author/</a></p>

    <p>&ldquo;[An] exquisitely accomplished  first book. Novelists dream of defining characters this swiftly and  beautifully, but Ms. Boo is not a novelist. She is one of those rare,  deep-digging journalists who can make truth surpass fiction, a documentarian  with a superb sense of human drama. She makes it very easy to forget that this  book is the work of a reporter. …. Comparison to Dickens is not unwarranted.&rdquo;<br />
      —Janet Maslin, <em>The New York Times</em><br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &ldquo;A jaw-dropping achievement, an instant classic of narrative nonfiction…With a  cinematic intensity…Boo transcends and subverts every cliché, cynical or  earnest, that we harbor about Indian destitution and gazes directly into the  hearts, hopes, and human promise of vibrant people whom you&rsquo;ll not soon  forget.&rdquo;<br />
      —<em>Elle </em><br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &ldquo;Extraordinary.&rdquo;<br />
      --<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;A shocking—and riveting—portrait of life in modern India. … This is one  stunning piece of narrative nonfiction … Boo&rsquo;s prose is electric.&rdquo;<br />
      —<em>O</em>, The Oprah Magazine<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &ldquo;Gripping…A brilliant novelistic narration.&rdquo; <br />
      –<em>Wall Street Journal </em></p>
