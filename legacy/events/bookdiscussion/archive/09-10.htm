    <p><em>Summers with Lincoln </em>"examines many of the nearly 200 memorials erected in the memory of Abraham Lincoln as part of a quest to 
    learn what these monuments meant when they were unveiled, mean to the nation today, and to him. This book is the first in 50 years 
    to explore Lincoln sculpture within the construct of post Civil Rights America." - <a href="http://www.jamespercoco.com/summers.htm">

	<p>Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p>  
	<p>The cast of characters includes Hitler and Goering, Gertrude Stein and Marc Chagall--not to mention works by artists from 
    Leonardo da Vinci to Pablo Picasso. And the story told in this superbly researched and suspenseful book is that of the Third 
    Reichs war on European culture and the Allies desperate effort to preserve it.From the Nazi purges of "Degenerate Art" and 
    Goering's shopping sprees in occupied Paris to the perilous journey of the Mona Lisa from Paris and the painstaking reclamation 
    of the priceless treasures of liberated Italy,<em> The Rape of Europa </em>is a sweeping narrative of greed, philistinism, and heroism 
    that combines superlative scholarship with a compelling drama. - from <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780679756866.html">

    <h2> <em>How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization</em> by Franklin Foer</h2>
    <h3 class="blacktext"><img src="../images/09-10/foer-author.jpg" alt="Franklin Foer" width="188" height="254" class="author" />About the Author</h3>
    <p>"Franklin Foer is an American political journalist and the editor of The New Republic. Foer graduated from Columbia in 1996. 
    Before joining The New Republic, Foer was a frequent contributor to the online magazine Slate. His writing has also appeared in 
    The New York Times, The Washington Post, Spin, U.S. News & World Report, Lingua Franca, The Atlantic Monthly, The Wall Street 
    Journal, New York and Foreign Policy. In 2004 he published his first book, <em>How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of 
    Globalization</em>." - from <a href="http://fora.tv/speaker/3796/Franklin_Foer">http://fora.tv/speaker/3796/Franklin_Foer</a></p>
    
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
    <p>"The global power of soccer might be a little hard for Americans, living in a country that views the game with the same 
    skepticism used for the metric system and the threat of killer bees, to grasp fully. But in Europe, South America, and elsewhere, 
    soccer is not merely a pastime but often an expression of the social, economic, politica<img src="../images/09-10/foer-cover.jpg" alt="How Soccer Explains the World" width="210" height="316" class="bookcover" />l, and racial composition of the 
    communities that host both the teams and their throngs of enthusiastic fans. New Republic editor Franklin Foer, a lifelong devotee 
    of soccer dating from his own inept youth playing days to an adulthood of obsessive fandom, examines soccer's role in various 
    cultures as a means of examining the reach of globalization. Foer's approach is long on soccer reportage, providing extensive 
    history and fascinating interviews on the Rangers-Celtic rivalry and the inner workings of AC Milan, and light on direct 
    discussion of issues like world trade and the exportation of Western culture. But by creating such a compelling narrative of 
    soccer around the planet, Foer draws the reader into these sport-mad societies, and subtly provides the explanations he promises 
    in chapters with titles like "How Soccer Explains the New Oligarchs", "How Soccer Explains Islam's Hope", and "How Soccer Explains 
    the Sentimental Hooligan." Foer's own passion for the game gives his book an infectious energy but still pales in comparison to 
    the religious fervor of his subjects. His portraits of legendary hooligans in Serbia and Britain, in particular, make the most 
    die-hard roughneck New York Yankees fan look like a choirboy in comparison. Beyond the thugs, Foer also profiles Nigerian players 
    living in the Ukraine, Iranian women struggling against strict edicts to attend matches, and the parallel worlds of Brazilian 
    soccer and politics from which Pele emerged and returned. Foer posits that globalization has eliminated neither local cultural 
    identities nor violent hatred among fans of rival teams, and it has not washed out local businesses in a sea of corporate wealth 
    nor has it quelled rampant local corruption. Readers with an interest in international economics are sure to like <em>How Soccer 
    Explains the World</em>, but soccer fans will love it."--John Moe  From

	<h2><em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life</em> By Barbara Kingsolver</h2>
	<h3 class="blacktext"><img src="../images/09-10/kingsolver-author.jpg" alt="Barbara Kingsolver" width="192" height="225" class="author" />About the Author</h3>
	<p>"Raised in Kentucky, Barbara Kingsolver was a journalist and science writer before the 1988 publication of her first novel, The 
    Bean Trees. The book drew critical praise, as have all her subsequent novels, including<em> Animal Dreams</em> (1990), <em>Pigs in Heaven</em> (1993), 
    <em>The Poisonwood Bible </em>(1998) and<em> Prodigal Summer </em>(2000). Kingsolver often writes about family and community in America, but she has 
    also written about the Congo, as well as essays, poems and stories. Her non-fiction books include <em>Holding the Line: Women in the 
    Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983</em> (1989) and <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em> (2007)." - from 
    <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/barbarakingsolver.html">http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/barbarakingsolver.html</a><img src="../images/09-10/kingsolver-cover.jpg" alt="Animal, Vegetable, Miracle Bookcover" width="186" height="280" class="bookcover" /></p>
    
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
	<p><em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em> chronicled Barbara Kingsolver's family's experiment of only eating what they could make or grow for 
    one year. This included not only just vegetables they grew in their garden, but chickens that they raised from birth, and cheese 
    they made from their milk from their own owns. Additionally, the family did not use any man-made techniques (ie canning) to keep 
    the food from spoiling. Everything that was consumed was kept fresh without chemicals. While most of the book chronicles the 
    family's diet, other chapters contrast what the now "traditional" methods of growing, packaging, preserving, and shipping similar 
    meals take in terms of money, man power, and the carbon foot print left behind. </p>

	<p><em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em> met with some of the highest praises of any previously published Barbara Kingsolver book. Time 
    Magazine declared it one of the Top Ten Nonfiction Books of the Year. - from
