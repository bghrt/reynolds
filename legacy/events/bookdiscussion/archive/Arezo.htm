		<hr>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
		<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF"><font face="Arial" size="2">I 
		was born and raised in Afghanistan. My father was in the Afghan Army. He 
		joined the Army when he was nineteen. My mother stayed at home and took 
		care of most of the household chores. Initially, we had a very simple 
		and peaceful life. My childhood memories are of homework, playing 
		marbles, flying kites or trips to our farm in Shamali. <br>
		<br>
		On April 27th 1978, the Communist Party seized control of the government 
		in a brutal coup. After that, our lives changed drastically. The entire 
		country found itself governed by an oppressive regime. Thousands were 
		tortured and killed. Anybody who was opposed to the government was 
		abducted from his home and killed in the political prison named 
		Pul-Charkhi. My father was among those who suffered in the Communists’ 
		hands. He refused to join the Communist Party and turned in his 
		resignation from the Army. Shortly thereafter he was arrested. We never 
		saw him after that. Months later, we learned that he had been killed in 
		Pul Charkhi. <br>
		<br>
		His death took a heavy toll on each and every one of us. Our lives were 
		never the same again. We went through the most depressing and difficult 
		times in our lives, all of which are covered in detail in my book. By 
		November of 1982, we were forced to flee the country. We hired a 
		smuggler who led us through the mountains of Afghanistan into Pakistan. 
		We stayed in Pakistan for one month. From there, we found another 
		smuggler who helped us obtain fake passports and visas. With these on 
		hand, we made it across the border into India. <br>
		<br>
		We lived in India as refugees for two years. We were solely dependent on 
		our monthly stipend from the United Nations. We had spent all of our 
		savings in our trip from Kabul to Delhi. We lived a life of poverty and 
		destitution. Desperate for a better life, we filed for political asylum 
		in the United States in early 1984. On October 31st, 1984, we migrated 
		to Richmond, Va.<br>
		<br>
		Life in the United States was not as easy as I had envisioned. We came 
		into this country with only the clothes on our backs. I could barely 
		speak the language. I had not finished high school. With the help of 
		friends and the Refugee Office in Richmond we were able to find a place 
		to stay. My older brother, older sister and I worked in order to support 
		our mother and three younger brothers. But I was determined to finish my 
		education and fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor. By January of 1986, 
		I managed to obtain my G.E.D certificate. With the certificate I became 
		eligible for college even though I had not finished high school. I 
		attended my classes during the day while I worked as a watchman during 
		the graveyard shift. By the fall of 1986, I started my education at 
		Reynolds. In the fall of 1987, I transferred my credits to VCU, where I 
		obtained my BS in Chemistry on May 19th 1990. <br>
		I was accepted at Eastern Virginia Medical School in 1991. On May 20th 
		1995, I obtained my degree in Medicine. I completed my Internal Medicine 
		residency at MCV in June of 1998. After the residency I pursued a 
		fellowship in gastroenterology. I completed my fellowship in the same 
		hospital on June 30th, 2001. I have been in private practice as a 
		gastroenterologist since then.<br>
		<br>
		With the encouragement of my coworkers and some of my classmates, I 
		started writing my memoirs in August of 1986. I would type snippets 
		about the past on pieces of paper while I worked at night. I have been 
		working on my manuscript ever since then. I was inspired by the support 
		and enthusiasm of my coworkers and some of my classmates. Writing about 
		my life has forced me to remember some of the most painful moments of my 
		life. It has resurfaced the grief, anger and bitterness that have lain 
		dormant for so long. At forty, I have been given a chance to look back 
		and appreciate how much I have been through in life. It has given me a 
		better perspective of my life and the man I am today. I would like to 
		share my memories in the hopes to inspire others to face their own 
		adversities and cope with their own haunting memories. I also hope that 
		what I have written will give the readers a glimpse of the anguish and 
		the pain that the Afghan people have lived through in the last 25 years. 
		Moreover, it is my hope that the readers will also have an appreciation 
		for the rich history and culture of Afghanistan.</font><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">
