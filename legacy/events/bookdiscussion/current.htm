<h3 class="blacktext">About the Book</h3>
    <p>&quot;An immigrant family is tested by a  series of problems in this unsentimental American dream story. Heavily  influenced by <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/let-it-rain-coffee-angie-cruz/1100334049?ean=9780743212045"><img src="images/13-14/let it wain coffee cover.jpg" width="116" height="180" align="right"/></a>American television, Esperanza Coln finally has enough money in  her secret savings to flee the Dominican Republic for New York, where she is  joined eventually by her husband, Santo, and their two children, Bobby and  Dallas. </p>
    <p>&quot;Ten years after they arrive, Santo's  widowed father, Don Chan, joins the crowded household. In New York Don Chan is  seized by nostalgia for his political past in the Dominican Republic. When  Santo is murdered in his cab, things begin to go downhill for the family.</p>
    <p>&quot;Don Chan loses his grip on the  present; Dallas, with her neighborhood friend Hush, navigates the tricky waters  of adolescence; Bobby inadvertently becomes involved in a shooting and is sent  to a juvenile detention facility. When yet another tragedy occurs, they all  return to the island, and each family member finds some measure of peace.  Cruz's unvarnished, sympathetic account of immigrant struggles suggests she is  a writer worth watching.&quot;&nbsp;<em>-Agent,  Ellen Levine.

    <h2><em>African  American Faces of the Civil War: an Album </em>by Ronald S. Coddington</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://ronaldscoddington.wordpress.com/marketing/"><img src="images/13-14/pvt. Abram Garvin.jpg" alt="Pvt. Abram Garvin" width="150" height="258" class="author" /></a><span class="blacktext">About the Author</span></h3>
	<p>&quot;A  renowned collector of Civil War photographs and a prodigious researcher, Ronald  S. Coddington combines compelling archival images with biographical stories  that reveal the human side of the war. </p>
	<p>	  &quot;During  the Civil War, 200,000 African American men enlisted in the Union army or navy.  Some of them were free men and some escaped from slavery; others were released  by sympathetic owners to serve the war effort.&nbsp;<em>African American Faces of the Civil  War</em>tells the story of the Civil War through the images of men of color who  served in roles that ranged from servants and laborers to enlisted men and  junior officers.<br />
	  </p>
	<p>&quot;Coddington  discovers these portraits in museums, archives, and private collections. He has  pieced together each individual’s life and fate based upon personal documents,  military records, and pension files. These stories tell of ordinary men who  became fighters, of the prejudice they faced, and of the challenges they  endured.&quot;&nbsp;-<em>from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/142140625X">Amazon</a></em></p>
<h3 class="blacktext">About the Book<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/african-american-faces-of-the-civil-war-ronald-s-coddington/1110919186?ean=9781421406251"><img src="images/13-14/african american faces of the civil war.jpg" width="137" height="210" alt="The Illustrated Man" align="right"/></a></h3>
<p>&quot;While other kids in his Middlesex, New Jersey, neighborhood were collecting baseball cards, fourteen-year-old Ron Coddington was browsing flea markets looking for old photographs. Over time, he focused his collection on Civil War era cartes de visite, a paper format popular during the 1860s.</p>
    <p>&quot;In 2001, he began writing Faces of War, a regular column in the Civil War News. Each month, Ron profiles a soldier, each illustrated with an original, wartime carte de visite photograph. Ron believes that appreciating the role of the volunteer soldier is key to understanding America's greatest conflict. </p>
    <p>&quot;In 2004, a collection of columns became part of Ron's first book, Faces of the Civil War: An Album of Union Soldiers and Their Stories. A companion volume, Faces of the Confederacy: An Album of Southern Soldiers and Their Stories, was published in 2008. Four years later, the publication of African American Faces of War: An Album marked the third book in the series. All three books were published by The Johns Hopkins University Press.&quot; <em>From the <a href="http://ronaldscoddington.wordpress.com/about/">Ronald S. Coddington</a> website.</em><br />

    <h2> <em>A Train in Winter</em> by Caroline Moorehead</h2>
    <h3 class="blacktext"><a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/authors/caroline-moorehead"><img src="images/13-14/caroline moorehead.jpg" alt="Katherine Boo" width="98" height="150" class="author" /></a>About the Author</h3>
    <p>&quot;Caroline Moorehead is the biographer of Bertrand Russell, Freya Stark, Iris Origo, and Martha Gellhorn. Well known for her work in human rights, she has published a history of the Red Cross and an acclaimed book about refugees, Human Cargo. Her previous book was Dancing to the Precipice, a biography of Lucie de la Tour du Pin. She lives in London and Italy.&quot;    - from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Train-Winter-Extraordinary-Friendship-Resistance/dp/product-description/0061650714/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books">Amazon.com</a></p>
    <h3 class="blacktext">About the Book<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-train-in-winter-caroline-moorehead/1103572925?ean=9780061650710"><img src="images/13-14/a train in winter.JPG" width="130" height="181" align="right"/></a></h3>
    <p>&quot;On the morning of Jan. 24, 1943,  German soldiers and French policemen herded 230 women aboard a train bound for  a destination about which these passengers knew nothing. About half of them  were communists who in one way or another had aided — or been charged with  aiding — the French Resistance. </p>
    <p>      &quot;When the train finally stopped, after a cold and  singularly unpleasant journey, the women found themselves in &ldquo;a vast white  snowy landscape, deserted, flat and frozen.&rdquo; They were marched across this  landscape, under a sign that read &ldquo;Arbeit  Macht Frei&rdquo; and into an immense camp. &ldquo;Had they heard the words  Auschwitz or Birkenau, they would have meant nothing to them.&rdquo; They stayed  there for two years, until the end of the war. </p>
<p>&quot;Forty-nine of them survived,  and, given the unspeakable conditions into which they were thrust, it is a  miracle that this many made it to freedom. &ldquo;They had lived because each of them  had been incredibly lucky, and because of the friendship between them, which  had protected them and made it easier to withstand the barbarity.&quot; - Jonathan Yardley, <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-11-25/entertainment/35282727_1_french-resistance-french-communists-german-soldiers">Washington Post</a></p>
