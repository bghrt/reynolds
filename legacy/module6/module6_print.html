<p><strong>Connect for Success</strong><br>Module 6 - Evaluating Sources of Information</p>

<h3><font size="5">Why evaluate?</font></h3>
<p>In today's information age anyone who has the necessary skills can find a wealth of information on almost any topic. We are inundated daily with information coming from various media including: books, periodicals, television, radio and the Internet. With a barrage of information growing daily, it is often difficult to recognize the reliability, relevancy and value of a particular resource, especially when trying to find material for a research assignment or paper. The challenge is to sift through a huge amount of information and identify sources that are reliable and appropriate.</p>
<p>While books and periodical articles found on the library shelves and in the library databases are reviewed by publishers and subject experts before publication, many web pages found through search engines like Google or Yahoo are not checked for accuracy or credibility. This lack of quality control allows ANYONE to publish their opinions and ideas on the Internet, including many people who may not be experts on the topics they write about. In light of these facts, you must think critically about what you find. It is the researcher's responsibility to evaluate the information found and judge its quality.</p>
<p>The following pages cover several <b>criteria</b> to help you in the evaluation process. Each evaluation criteria includes a checklist of questions to ask and points to consider when evaluating any information source.</p>

<h3><font size="5">Authority</font></h3>
<p>What are the author's credentials? Does the author have expertise on the subject?</p>
<p><b>How can I find out?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Search for contact information (name, e-mail address, institution).</li>
<li>Search for the author's credentials. Is the author affiliated with a university, organization, institution, or association? Search the author in a licensed database index such as Academic Search Complete or WorldCat to find out about whether or not the author has other publications. Search the author's name on Google. Is he/she listed as author of other Web publications? &nbsp;</li>
<li>Is there an organization, publisher, or corporate author listed? Who is producing or sponsoring the site? A university? A government agency? An organization? Is the organization profit or nonprofit? Do you see a university or corporate logo? Is the site someone's personal web page?</li>
<li>Look at the web address (URL). Is the top level domain an <i>.edu</i> or <i>.org</i>? If you cannot tell anything about the producer of the site from the page you are on, delete part of the URL address back to the main address or first forward slash (/). This will take you to the home page of the site. From there you may be able to find out who is sponsoring it.</li>
<li>Check a biographical source:</li>
</ul>
<table cellspacing="0" align="center" cellpadding="3" width="80%" class="bannerstyletable" border="1">
<tr>
<td>
<p>There will be many times during your years in college and later in life that you will need to find biographical information about a person. The library has dozens of biographical sources in the reference area. A researcher often doesn't know which one will contain information on the person of interest. Some basic sources to try are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Articles</b>: Find articles in databases such as: Literature Resource Center or Academic Search Complete.</li>
<li><b>Encyclopedia articles</b>: Look in general or specialized encyclopedias for a brief summary of an author's life. Use the VCCSLinc Library Catalog to find both print and online encyclopedias.</li>
<li><b>Books</b>: Do a subject search in VCCSLinc Library Catalog to find print and online books that detail a person's life.</li>
</ul>

<p>A review is a critical evaluation. By reading reviews, you can determine the quality of a book or movie.</p>
<h3>Book Reviews:</h3>
<p>Books are reviewed in newspapers, magazines, and scholarly journals. Ordinarily a book will be reviewed within a year after it is published, although it may be reviewed later.&nbsp; The following are two sources for finding book reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Search Complete</li>
<li>Books in Print</li>
</ul>
<h3>Movie Reviews</h3>
<p>Like books, films are also reviewed in magazines and newspapers. Movies are also reviewed on the Internet by a variety of websites. The following are two sources for locating movie reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Search Complete</li>
<li>Internet Movie Database</li>

<h3><font size="5">Timeliness</font></h3>
<p>When was the information published? Is the date of publication important to the subject matter? Is the information current enough for your needs?</p>
<p><b>How can I find out?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Look for a publication date, a last updated date or revised date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine whether it is important to use current sources for the subject you are researching.</p>
</li>
<li>If you are using a web resource, do the links to other web pages or web sites work?</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Web Sites:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Many web sites and pages are not updated and may provide outdated information.</li>
<li>If a date is provided, it may have various meanings. For example, it may indicate when the site or page was:</li>
<ul>
<li>first written</li>
<li>last revised</li>
<li>placed on the web</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><b>Subject Areas:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In fields such as <i>medicine</i>, <i>science</i>, <i>business</i>, and <i>technology</i>, the currency of the information is important. New breakthroughs frequently appear, and older information may not be useful or valid.</li>
<li>In fields such as <i>history</i> and <i>literature</i>, older materials may be just as valuable as newer ones.</li>

<ol>
<li>Does the author support his or her statements with data or references to research?</li>

<h3><font size="5">Suitability</font></h3>
<p>Does the source contain the information you need? Is it written at a level you can understand?</p>
<p>How can I find out?</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the source. If it contains too much technical or specialized language or if it is written for experts in the field, you may wish to choose another source.</li>
<li>Determine whether the information is too general or too specific for your need.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="testyourself_custom.png" border="0" title="insert number here" alt="Toggle open/close quiz question"></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<h3><font size="5">Review process</font></h3>
<p>If the source is a periodical article, you need to ask yourself if it was reviewed (refereed) before publication? If the source is a book, what is the reputation of the publisher? If it is from the Internet, was there any review process at all prior to the page being posted? Was it critically reviewed after it was written?</p>
<p><b>How can I find out?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>To find out whether a journal is peer reviewed or refereed: review the front pages of the print journal or the journal web page; check the print or online version of Ulrich's Periodical Directory; or limit your search to peer reviewed journals using EBSCOhost databases such as Academic Search Complete.</li>
<li>Information may be published by an association, a university press, a commercial publisher, or a government. If you know something about the publisher, you can often identify bias and point of view.</li>
<li>Many Internet sources are not reviewed before being posted; however, government, educational, and organizational sites usually have some sort of review process. (Beware of personal home pages at educational institutions however). If no review process is stated or evident, you may assume there is none.</li>
<li>Read a critical review of books or movies:</li>
