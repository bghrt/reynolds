  <p>And finally the year of publication.  Here's a question: what do you do if you can't find a date on the webpage.  The first things is: don't make it up.  If it isn't there, you can't put it there.  The second things is: think about whether the source is really worth citing.  If you're writing a paper about how to treat diabetes, for example, it's really important to know that you're citing a source with relatively recent content. Topics on health or current events can change by the week or month.  But finally, if you're really attached to the source and think it offers legit content, add this.  <strong>N.d.</strong> What does N.d stand for?  No Date.  You're telling your reader, you tried to find this information and it just wasn't there. </p></div>
