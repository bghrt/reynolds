  <p>Including the web address at the end of the citation is optional.  Here's the rule of thumb: if you can go to Google, enter key words like the website and webpage title and find the citation, it's generally OK to skip including the web address.  BUT, if your reader/instructor will have a hard time finding the source without the direct web address, go ahead and include it.  <strong>Really though, talk to your instructor</strong>.  Often s/he has a strong opinion regarding whether to use the web address or not. </p></div>
