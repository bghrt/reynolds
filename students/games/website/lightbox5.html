  <p>You may not realize it, but websites just like books, always have publishers.  The problem is, sometimes it's not exactly clear who the publisher is.  Some suggestions: look at the bottom right corner of a website or the About Us link.  The about page is typically an indicator of the publisher.  That said, if you've looked all over still cannot figure out who the publisher is, add the phrase: <strong>N.p</strong>. in this spot.  What does N.p. stand for?  No publisher. </p></div>
