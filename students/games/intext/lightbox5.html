<p>This is tricky.  What does par. mean and why did we add it?   Par stands for paragraph and we used it because we are citing an <strong>online</strong> article.  When citing something online don't include page numbers.  Ever.  Why?  Because if you print something from on online source, it might be 7 pages to one printer or 8 pages to another printer.  Using the paragraph number for online sources is more precise.  It tells the reader exactly where you got that information.</p>

<p>Here's something else worth pointing out: the period always goes after the in-text citation at the very end.  Don't use two periods when quoting or paraprasing - just one period, at the very end.</p>

<script>
	$(".lightBoxClose").click(function () {
		$("#lightBox").fadeOut('slow',function(){
		$(".lightboxWrap").remove();
		});
	});
</script>
</div>
