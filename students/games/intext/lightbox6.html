<div class="closeLightbox"></div>
<p>So you'll need the author's last name and the page number for your in-text citation.  Why?  Because you did not indicate, within the context of the sentence, who the author is.  If you had written, "According to Bukiet..." all you would have to include at the end is the page number.




But, just as an FYI, one of the best ways to indicate to your reader that you're using someone else's words is to start the sentence with the phrase, &quot;According to...&quot;. It's a great way to start a quote, paraphrase or summary. </p>
</div>

<script>
	$(".lightBoxClose").click(function () {
		$("#lightBox").fadeOut('slow',function(){
		$(".lightboxWrap").remove();
		});
	});
</script>
</div>
