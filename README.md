My main focus on V2 libguides was to develop a side nav template that visually integrated with our main site.

You can see what that looks like in most of our libguides including this one: http://libguides.reynolds.edu/issues

The 3 column template will give you the side nav, and of course, the CSS.Lesser modified are the landing page, and I did modify the tab nav for libguides, although I have requested my colleagues to use the side nav when possible.

I made a couple of executive decisions regarding V2 (that were OK with my awesome colleagues).

1. No libguides search box: The scope -libguides content only - is confusing to students and generally students confuse the search box with actual databases.
2. No wonky styling with things like fonts - I've !important-ed a lot of strange font types: Consistency is key for me and though I feel kind of bad overwriting someone's Comic Sans font, consistent type face and colors really is the best for everyone.
3. No breadcrumbs, tags, or guide descriptions for any of the modified templates: V2 is spendid, but still so much more clutter than needed.
4. Only side nav.  This aligns both with our root site and web UI standards which not that side nav is the way to go.


So that's it.
